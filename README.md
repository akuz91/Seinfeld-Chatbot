# Seinfeld-Chatbot

This project was conducted as part of the course requirements for Natural Language Processing with Representation Learning (DS-GA-1011) at NYU. The project involved generating conversations between two characters from the TV sitcom Seinfeld. We first performed baseline modeling using Seq2Seq models. Next, we experimented with fine-tuning a pre-trained transformer model on individual characters separately, and having the dialogue agents converse with each other. Modeling was performed with and without hand-crafted personas, however our hypothesis, that the model can effectively produce indentity-distinct and context-sensitive responses, proved to be true.
